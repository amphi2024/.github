# One Server, Sync All
**Amphi apps sync your notes, music (coming), files (planned), and photos(planned) through a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-set-up server—across every platform, for free, and open source.**

## Problems We Solve

* Setting up sync servers is too complex and time-consuming
* Most sync solutions are heavy, platform-limited, or expensive
* Users don’t truly control their own data
* Syncing across multiple apps usually requires separate configurations
* Open-source alternatives lack ease-of-use or integration
* Many apps are bloated or slow
* Most tools don't offer a clean, minimal UI
